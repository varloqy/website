    <h1>Cybersecurity</h1>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>In my journey to learn cybersecurity I have begun with building and deploying my home lab across multiple machines and residential IOT devices.<br>
    I have so far configured multiple devices running either various linux distibutions such as debian/ubuntu or arch and some devices running windows.<br>
    Along with setting up and configuring multiple devices I have also hardened my home network of isolating IOT devices to their own restricted subnet to prevent crosstalking with more sensitive devices.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>While building my home lab I am also taking online lessons through <a href="https://tryhackme.com/p/varloq">TryHackMe</a> to further my learning into cybersecurity and to refine my knowledge in IT fundamentals and networking protocols.</p>
    <h2>Current sybersec projects</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Bug Bounty hunting through HackerOne to learn and explore web app vulnerabilities and further understand the OWASP Top 10</li>
        <li>Further network and device hardening while conforming to best practices</li>
    </ul>
