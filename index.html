    <h1>Portfolio by Evan Neff</h1>
    <hr>
    

    <p class="double">Welcome to my professional portfolio page!<br>
    <br>
    I would like to start with a small introduction about myself.
    <br>
    <br>
    My name is Evan Neff and I have a strong passion for technology and hands-on work.
    I have experience in various professional fields such as information technology, welding, and automotive diagnostics and repair.<br>
    I am currently wanting to persue a career in cybersecurity with the end goal of becomeing a red team penetration tester.
    I have a strong interest in learning the fundamentals of how computers work from individual electrons flowing through copper traces and transistors
    all the way to utilizing various programming languages to create or improve software.
    <br>
    <br>
    I was born in 1999 in Auburn, California and grew up in the small fruit packing town of Loomis, California. I attended High school at Del Oro High School where I took classes in programming, welding and small engine repair. During my time in high school I became interested in computers and started learning about computer hardware. With my knowledge I helped people repair their computers from failed components to broken laptop screens.
     I also provided my knowledge to people building their own computers from choosing hardware to fit a need and a budget as well as assembling the computer for them.
    In my Junior year of high school I started doing work for the school as a part of the IT team aiding the IT director with providing support for student and faculty. Leading into my senior year of high school the IT director noticed my skills and knowledge and started providing me with higher level tasks 
    in the form of completing support tickets that other people in the team weren't able to complete. Other tasks included software and hardware upgrades throughout the school and aiding in the development and deployment of new networks.
    <br>
    <br>
    I attended college at Sierra College in Rocklin, California and while attending I went through the trade program for welding and metallurgy for my main focus however, once I finished college and got into the welding field I realized that 
    welding was not the right fit for me for a long term career. After working in the welding field I hopped around a few different job fields all working with my hands doing 
    jobs such as concrete work, plumbing, residential HVAC and machining. Finally I settled into doing automotive work both in diagnosing and repairing all systems
    and componentes on vehicles.
    <br>
    <br>
    I worked in the automotive field at a few locations with changing shops from when I moved from California to Texas or from a lack of work and changing companies to follow the work caused
     by the automotive industry being commission based pay and can be volitile at times based on the time of year and availibility of parts.
    Starting in 2023 I started my own small business on the side of my full time job called Neff Automotive performing automotive diagnostics and repairs as a mobile mechanic.
    <br>
    <br>
    Following the start of my business in August of 2024 I left the automotive industy to be able to have access at all times to my tools and equipment to continue my business and went back into the welding field as a temporary career choice.
    <br>
    <br>
    While working in the welding field again, I continued working with computers on my own time and realised that what I really wanted to persue in life is cybersecurity. Following this realization I started building my own home lab and and continued my learning into various programming languages.
    So far I have become fairly proficient in Python and bash scripting and have started learning C++ with an occational peek into assembly for reverse engineering compiled programs.
    With this development I have started expanding my learning and currently persuing online courses through TryHackMe to learn more about cybersecurity and basic networking protocols. I am currently expanding my knowledge of Python and C++ and learning more about vulnerabilities and exploits by utilizing resources such at PicoCTF and Hacker101 CTF labs as well as learning how to prevent and fix vulnerabilities.
    Along with the online lessons and experiance in labs I am also developing my own tools and using my home lab to expand my networking knowledge. In my off-time when I am not working or studying I enjoy working on my cars and spending time with my wife and kids.
